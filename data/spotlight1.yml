  Kyouhei Sakaguchi's "Kemono Ni Naru Koto" stands as a radical experiment in consciousness and language where the boundaries between self and other, human and animal, writing and being dissolve into a flowing stream of becoming, operating less as traditional storytelling than as philosophical incantation—a spell cast upon language itself to induce what the narrator calls delirium. The writing style defies conventional categorization through Sakaguchi's technique of "giving language narcotics," fragmenting linear thought into associative cascades where sentences bloom into unexpected territories of meaning, moving with the logic of dreams and fever rather than cause-and-effect progression, following instead the rhizomatic connections of a mind in perpetual transformation. Drawing explicitly from Deleuze and Guattari's concept of "becoming animal," the text enacts its own theory through its very construction as the narrator claims to be Deleuze himself—not as biographical identity but as embodiment of philosophical principles of multiplicity and metamorphosis—creating writing as ritual, physical practice, and acupuncture performed upon consciousness itself. The language shifts between intimate confession and cosmic abstraction, between the microscopic (molecules, cells, DNA) and the vast (dinosaurs, geological strata, nebulae), with sentences that stretch and contract like living tissue, sometimes extending into breathless catalog poems of transformation, other times fragmenting into staccato observations, repeatedly circling back to create spirals rather than straight lines, reflecting the narrator's stated method of writing "extemporaneously" and "without preparation." As the work progresses into increasing violence and ecstasy, moving from philosophical meditation into linguistic warfare, the narrator's "body rebellion" erupts into scenes of transformation so radical they approach the apocalyptic, where suicide becomes metamorphosis and the act of becoming animal involves dissolution of human categories so complete that language itself stutters and breaks down, with the repeated phrase "It's a hoax, a hoax, a hoax" serving as mantra of rejection against human institutions and interpretations. The writing enacts what it describes—telephone conversations between disembodied voices, a man without vocal cords communicating through vibration, the narrator losing body parts while maintaining connection through improvised technology—not as metaphors but as literal descriptions of reality where consciousness has been drugged into new configurations and boundaries between self and world chemically dissolved, offering experimental literature in the truest sense that actively experiments with the possibilities of what writing can do to and with consciousness, providing not a story to be consumed but a practice to be experienced, a linguistic technology for inducing states of becoming that exceed individual self-boundaries, functioning as literature as shamanic practice and biological warfare against the tyranny of stable identity.
